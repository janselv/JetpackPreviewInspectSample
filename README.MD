# Jetpack Compose Previews: Delving Deep into Their Inner Workings

This sample app demonstrates how Jetpack Compose Previews work under the hood. It is meant as a 
companion to the **Jetpack Compose Previews: Delving Deep into Their Inner Workings** blog post.

It will support understanding how to run previews using the `adb` command-line tool, how previews 
are compiled, and how to run composables that are not annotated with the `@Preview` annotation.
